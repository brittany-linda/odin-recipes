                <li>2 cups cheese (mozzarella)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 ounce active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
                <li>1-1/4 cups warm water</li>
                <li>1/2 pound pepperoni</li>
                <li>15 ounces tomato sauce</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons dried oregeno</li>
                <li>1 medium green pepper, diced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. 
                    Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.</li>
                <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. 
                    Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise 
                    in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and 
                    onion over medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; 
                    drain.</li>
                <li>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. 
                    Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef 
                    mixture, green pepper and cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
